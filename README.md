The book: It's in the repo. ;)

Hey, you!

My name is Daudi (some people know me as Lucas) and I'm speaking to you behind
a computer screen. Isn't that kinda weird?

Anyway, as a fellow programmer, learning C as my first programming language is
one of the most challenging things to endure.

That's why I created this repo; to help people who are in a similar place!

While the experience is primarily gained in the terminal breaking and rebuilding
code, I decided to create a system of notetaking to help me out.

I come from a design background, so I aim to offer insight from a
creative perspective and help others out, too.
